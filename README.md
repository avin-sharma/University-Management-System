# University Management System

## Dependencies
You need to have `prettytables` package installed on your environment to run this python project.

## Running the program
Run `app.py`

The program expects you to provide file path of a folder that contains students.txt, instructors.txt, grades.txt and majors.txt, along with the separators of each file.

If you want to work with multiple Universities, just have multiple folders with the 4 files and initialize them in the program.
